Admiral William H. McRaven (U.S. Navy Retired) served with great distinction in the Navy. In Make Your Bed, he builds on these principles by sharing inspiring tales from his own life and those around him in the military, explaining how anyone can use these basic lessons to change themselves for the better.

Notes from “McRaven, William H.. Make Your Bed. Penguin Books Ltd. Kindle Edition.”

### 1. Start your day with a task completed

**If you want to change the world… start off by making your bed.**

You search for something that can give you solace, that can motivate you to begin your day, that can be a sense of pride in an oftentimes ugly world. But it is not just combat. It is daily life that needs this same sense of structure. Nothing can replace the strength and comfort of one’s faith, but sometimes the simple act of making your bed can give you the lift you need to start your day and provide you the satisfaction to end it right. (p. 9).

### 2. You can’t go it alone

**If you want to change the world… find someone to help you paddle.**

None of us are immune from life’s tragic moments. Like the small rubber boat we had in basic SEAL training, it takes a team of good people to get you to your destination in life. You cannot paddle the boat alone. Find someone to share your life with. Make as many friends as possible, and never forget that your success depends on others. (p. 21).

### 3. Only the size of your heart matters

**If you want to change the world … measure a person by the size of their heart.**

SEAL training was always about proving something. Proving that size didn’t matter. Proving that the color of your skin wasn’t important. Proving that money didn’t make you better. Proving that determination and grit were always more important than talent. (pp. 27-28).

In 1969, Tommy Norris was almost booted out of SEAL training. They said he was too small, too thin, and not strong enough. But much like the young sailor in my class, Norris proved them all wrong and once again showed that it’s not the size of your flippers that count, just the size of your heart. (p. 34).

### 4. Life’s Not Fair—Drive On!

**If you want to change the world … get over being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward.**

Somewhere during the morning’s physical training I had “committed a violation of the SEAL training rules.” My punishment was to jump into the surf zone, roll around in the sand, and make myself a “sugar cookie.” (p. 38).

“Mr. Mac, do you have any idea why you are a sugar cookie this morning?” Martin said in a very calm but questioning manner. “No, Instructor Martin,” I dutifully responded. “Because, Mr. Mac, life isn’t fair and the sooner you learn that the better off you will be.” (p. 39).

Sometimes no matter how hard you try, no matter how good you are, you still end up as a sugar cookie. Don’t complain. Don’t blame it on your misfortune. Stand tall, look to the future, and drive on! (p. 42).

### 5. Failure Can Make You Stronger

**If you want to change the world … don’t be afraid of The Circus.**

The Circus was another two hours of additional calisthenics, combined with nonstop harassment by SEAL combat veterans who wanted only the strong to survive training. If you failed to meet the standard on any event that day—calisthenics, the obstacle course, the timed runs, or the swims—your name was on the list. In the eyes of the instructors, you were a failure. (p. 47).

In life you will face a lot of Circuses. You will pay for your failures. But, if you persevere, if you let those failures teach you and strengthen you, then you will be prepared to handle life’s toughest moments. (p. 51).

### 6. You Must Dare Greatly

**If you want to change the world … slide down the obstacle headfirst.**

Life is a struggle and the potential for failure is ever present, but those who live in fear of failure, or hardship, or embarrassment will never achieve their potential. Without pushing your limits, without occasionally sliding down the rope headfirst, without daring greatly, you will never know what is truly possible in your life. (p. 63).

### 7. Stand Up to the Bullies

**If you want to change the world … don’t back down from the sharks.**

Bullies are all the same; whether they are in the school yard, in the workplace, or ruling a country through terror. They thrive on fear and intimidation. Bullies gain their strength through the timid and faint of heart. They are like sharks that sense fear in the water. They will circle to see if their prey is struggling. They will probe to see if their victim is weak. If you don’t find the courage to stand your ground, they will strike. In life, to achieve your goals, to complete the night swim, you will have to be men and women of great courage. That courage is within all of us. Dig deep, and you will find it in abundance. (p. 72).

### 8. Rise to the Occasion

**If you want to change the world … be your very best in the darkest moments.**

The SEAL instructors paced back and forth in front of the twenty-five pairs of divers preparing for the night’s dive. The instructors seemed as nervous as we were. They knew that this training event had the highest potential for someone to get hurt or die. (p. 76).

“Tonight, you will have to be your very best. You must rise above your fears, your doubts, and your fatigue. No matter how dark it gets, you must complete the mission. This is what separates you from everyone else.” Somehow those words stayed with me for the next thirty years. (p. 77).

At some point we will all confront a dark moment in life. If not the passing of a loved one, then something else that crushes your spirit and leaves you wondering about your future. In that dark moment, reach deep inside yourself and be your very best. (p. 81).

### 9. Give People Hope

**If you want to change the world … start singing when you’re up to your neck in mud.**

I could sense that some of the students were ready to accept his offer. After all, how much longer could we survive in the mud? A warm fire, hot coffee, and chicken soup sure sounded good. But then came the catch. All he needed was for five of us to quit. Just five quitters and the rest of the class could have some relief from the pain. (pp. 87-88).

Suddenly, above the howl of the wind came a voice. Singing. It was tired and raspy, but loud enough to be heard by all. The lyrics were not meant for tender ears, but everyone knew the tune. One voice became two and two became three and then before long everyone was singing. (p. 88).

We will all find ourselves neck deep in mud someday. That is the time to sing loudly, to smile broadly, to lift up those around you and give them hope that tomorrow will be a better day. (p. 94).

### 10. Never, Ever Quit!

**If you want to change the world … don’t ever, ever ring the bell.**

“But if you don’t like the pain, if you don’t like all the harassment, then there is an easy way out.” He pulled the rope again and another wave of deep metallic sound reverberated off the buildings. “All you have to do to quit is ring this bell three times.” (p. 98).

Life is full of difficult times. But someone out there always has it worse than you do. If you fill your days with pity, sorrowful for the way you have been treated, bemoaning your lot in life, blaming your circumstances on someone or something else, then life will be long and hard. If, on the other hand, you refuse to give up on your dreams, stand tall and strong against the odds—then life will be what you make of it—and you can make it great. Never, ever, ring the bell! (pp. 103-104).
