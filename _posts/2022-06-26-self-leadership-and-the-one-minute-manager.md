In this captivating business parable, bestselling author Ken Blanchard tells the story of Steve, a young advertising executive who is about to lose his job. During a series of talks with a gifted magician named Cayla, Steve comes to realize the power of taking responsibility for his situation and not playing the victim. Passing along the knowledge she has learned from The One Minute Manager, Cayla teaches Steve the three tricks of self leadership. These three techniques not only empower him to keep his job, but give him the skills he needs to keep growing, learning, and achieving.

Notes from, “Blanchard, Ken. Self Leadership and the One Minute Manager: Gain the mindset and skillset for getting what you need to succeed (p. 21). HarperCollins Publishers. Kindle Edition.”

### Do You Believe in Magic?

“If you don’t mind me saying so, it sounds as though you’re full of excuses—a poor victim of circumstance.” (p. 21). 

“I mean a person who refuses to accept responsibility for the situation he’s in. It’s easier to blame everyone else around you, rather than accepting responsibility for yourself,” Cayla replied without apology. (p. 21). 

“You have to turn the problem upside-down,” Cayla continued, “so that you’re the one on top. It’s time to stop looking for excuses and start proactively leading yourself.” (p. 23). 

“Yes,” she replied. “You need to stop thinking of empowerment as a four-letter word and realize that it is a grand opportunity. You need to start taking the lead to get what you need. (p. 24). 

There was a long pause as Steve pondered Cayla’s challenge. Finally, he said in a soft voice, “I think I get it. Rhonda empowered me to do a job, and I failed to take the initiative and responsibility for succeeding in it. I played the role of a victim. The problem with being empowered is that when things go wrong, you have no excuses. There’s no one to blame but yourself.” (p. 24).

**“Empowerment is something someone gives you. Self leadership is what you do to make it work.”** (p. 24). 

### People Are Not Mind Readers

The group began a raging debate over the most important motivators. Each had their own rationale for their ranking. As the noise level escalated, Ricardo came out of his office to investigate. “What’s going on?” he asked. “It’s about the survey I sent you earlier today,” Steve said, handing him a copy. (p. 30). 

“I can’t believe I’ve worked with this team for years without knowing what’s really important to you.” Steve said, “That’s the point of this exercise! (p. 30). 

Steve thought about his discussions with Cayla. She’d said this survey would reinforce what he’d learned earlier and lead to the first trick of self leadership. Suddenly, the dots connected in Steve’s mind. (p. 31). 

Feeling true excitement about his insight, Steve looked at each of his colleagues one by one and declared: **“Ultimately, it’s in your own best interest to accept responsibility for getting what you need to succeed in the workplace.”** (p. 31).

### Elephant Thinking

Cayla nodded. “Elephant thinking.” “Excuse me?” “You’ve limited yourself based on your past experiences,” she said. “When they begin to train an elephant, they chain the baby elephant’s leg to a pole in the ground. The baby elephant wants to get away. He pulls and tugs, but he can’t escape—the chain is too big and the pole is too deep in the ground. So he stops trying. As he grows up, he just assumes he can’t get away. (pp. 34-35). 

“What’s a consumed restraint?” Steve asked. She laughed at his mangled terminology, then clarified: **“An assumed constraint is a belief that limits your experience.”** (pp. 35-36). 

**The First Trick of a Self Leader: CHALLENGE ASSUMED CONSTRAINTS!**

He noticed he had everyone’s complete attention. “My presentation was fine, and the effort you gave was fine. What didn’t work was the lack of an agreed-upon budget and overall strategy. You can’t create something in a vacuum—and for that, I accept responsibility.” (p. 38). 

Steve was floored by the team’s comments. All this time he had assumed their disdain was for him, when actually it was the client that they had issues with. (p. 38). 

“It’s a belief that limits your experience,” Steve said. “I now realize I gave up on the creative process because I assumed you and Peter should have all the answers. I gave up on Rhonda because I assumed she had given up on me. And I gave up on United Bank because I assumed they were nuts!” There. He’d spoken the truth. (p. 41).

### Cycles of Power

“I’m guessing,” Cayla continued, “but tell me if I’m wrong: Yesterday you accepted responsibility, challenged assumed constraints, and decided to fight for your job and the client. The problem is, you don’t know where to begin. You feel powerless.” (pp. 45-46). 

“Why do you think you feel that way?” Cayla asked. “Because I’m not in a position to get people to do what I want them to do,” Steve replied emphatically. “Isn’t that interesting?” Cayla strapped her helmet on the back of her bike and said, **“Not realizing your own power could be your greatest assumed constraint.”** (p. 50). 

As he completed the order form, Woody called out to the parts man behind him, “I’ll also need a 32591–80 and a set of 31986–65Cs. Thanks, Joey.” Steve was impressed. “That’s quite a skill you have there. How did you memorize all those part numbers?” (p. 52). 

Woody pointed at Cayla. “Actually, she’s the one who helped me realize that knowing the system and part numbers is an important **point of power**. It’s really helped me build credibility in this industry. I’ve had a terrific career, and I don’t even have a tattoo!” (pp. 52-53). 

Hal pointed to a plaque on the counter. “This is our leadership credo,” he said. THERE’S ONLY POWER IN EMPOWERMENT IF YOU ARE A SELF LEADER. (p. 58).

“As you can see,” Cayla continued, “the first point of power is **knowledge power** as Woody has; second is **personal power** as the service reps have; third is **relationship power** as Jim and Lisa have; fourth is **task power** as Dee Dee has; and fifth is **position power** as Hal has.” Steve furrowed his brow. “I think I get it now,” he said. “You need to know the nature of your strengths—your power—before you can lead yourself.” (pp. 59-60). Edition.

**The Second Trick of Self Leadership: ACTIVATE YOUR POINTS OF POWER!** 

### Diagnose Yourself

Competence means you have the knowledge and skill to accomplish the goal or do the skill in question. If you’ve never done the trick before, then you can’t possibly have knowledge or skill. You are at the learning stage. (p. 66). 

“The Development Continuum is simply a model of four stages people usually experience when they are learning to master something.” (p. 67). 

“The first development level, D1, is called the enthusiastic beginner stage. That’s where you began. If you make it through the second level, the D2 or disillusioned learner stage—where you are now—then you reach D3, which is known as the capable but cautious performer stage. Finally, when you have mastered the skill, you reach D4 or the self-reliant achiever stage.” (p. 69).

“When you are at the disillusioned learner stage of your goal and you lack competence and commitment, you are not a failure if you thoughtfully decide it is not worth the time and effort to proceed,” she said. “You are a self leader proactively accepting responsibility.” (p. 70). 

### Getting What You Need

For each development level, there is a corresponding leadership style to provide you with the appropriate amount of direction and/or support you need. At the D1—enthusiastic beginner stage, you need an S1 leadership style: directing. At the D2—disillusioned learner stage, you need an S2 leadership style: coaching. At the D3—capable but cautious performer stage, you need an S3 leadership style: supporting. At the D4—self-reliant achiever stage, you need an S4 leadership style: delegating. (pp. 84-85). 

“Regression is a great word to describe what happened to me,” Steve said. “I was at the self-reliant achiever stage on budgets and production scheduling when I worked with Rhonda. But I’ve become so discouraged lately that if she called me to do the same things I used to do, I’m not sure I’d have the confidence to do them. I’ve definitely regressed from the self-reliant achiever stage to the capable but cautious performer stage.” (pp. 85-86).

### Running Together

As the sun came up Saturday morning, Steve put on his running gear, did some quick warm-ups, and headed out the door to pick up Blair. (p. 94).

“I remember now,” said Steve. “You went to a friend who was a high school cross-country coach and he helped you put a training program together. You used your relationship power to find someone with knowledge power.” “That’s right,” said Blair. “My coach helped me map out an entire strategy that included a running support group, getting feedback on my breathing and running technique, subscribing to a running magazine, and recruiting you to encourage me to keep up with my training schedule.” (pp. 95-96). 

“Which reminds me of a favorite quote,” said Blair: **“A person who does not have a goal is used by someone who does.”** (p. 96). 

Blair smiled. “I get it,” she said between breaths. “I acted as though I were at the self-reliant achiever stage—starting up front, thinking I could outpace or at least keep pace with the best. I was at the classic enthusiastic beginner stage! So that’s why I’m now at the disillusioned learner stage. It didn’t take me long to get from D1 to D2, did it?” She clearly didn’t need an answer. (p. 99). 

“Keep going, one step at a time,” Steve replied. For the rest of the race, Blair asked Steve for the direction and support she needed. She encouraged herself out loud so Steve could add something if he thought she needed it. (p. 100). 

The race helped Steve realize: **There is joy in diagnosing your development level and getting the direction and support you need to achieve your goal.** (p. 102). 

“That woman paid for you.” The attendant pointed up ahead, where a small woman on a Harley-Davidson roared out the exit. “She said something about how special you are,” the attendant said as he handed Steve a receipt. (p. 103). 

“Well, this is no ordinary parking receipt,” Blair said as she held it up for Steve to see. The receipt was emblazoned with the message. (p. 103).

### No Excuses

Steve pulled out the multipage plan that he and Blair had created and handed it to Cayla. It was then that he realized they hadn’t gotten their coffee and scones. As the server walked by, Steve caught his attention. “Excuse me,” he said abruptly. “Is our order on the way?” “I’ll check,” said the server as he walked off. (p. 107). 

Cayla put her finger to her mouth. “Watch,” she whispered. As the server walked by again, Cayla reached out to get his attention. “Excuse me, Gary. I need to ask you about our order. My colleague here is getting grumpy without his morning java!” she said with a smile. “Oh, I know the feeling! Let me check.” The server turned around and hurried back to the coffee counter. “Thank you!” Cayla called, oozing appreciation. (pp. 107-108). 

Cayla provided the answer. “I used the two most powerful words in the English language for getting cooperation.” Steve waited to hear what the two words were. “I need,” Cayla declared. (p. 108). 

“I said get the feedback—I didn’t say ask for it. Let me be more precise. Don’t put the request in the form of a question. In this case, playing Jeopardy! puts you in jeopardy.” Cayla smiled at her play on words before reinforcing: **“The two most powerful words to get what you need to succeed are, ‘I NEED.’”** (p. 109).

For the next hour, Cayla helped Steve create an agenda for his meeting with Rhonda. Finally, it was time for Steve to go. (p. 112). 

Rhonda laughed. “I’m sorry,” Rhonda said, trying to control her amusement. “I remember hearing a story—who knows if it’s true, but it’s a great story—about Tom Watson, the legendary leader of IBM. A young man sent to Watson’s office was terrified because he’d been in charge of a project that had lost thousands of dollars—maybe millions... The young man sat there stunned and asked the same question you just asked me—‘You’re not going to fire me?’ You know what Watson said?” (pp. 116-117). 

“Story has it that Watson bellowed, ‘Fire you? I just spent thousands of dollars training you, why would I fire you?’” Rhonda laughed her hearty, full-throated laugh. “Steve, I’m in the same boat as Watson. I figure you’ve learned more in the last week than any MBA program could teach. I can’t afford to fire you!” (p. 117). 

Rhonda seemed relieved that the responsibility was not entirely hers. “So you’re saying, **“A leader is anyone who can give you the support and direction you need to achieve your goal.”** (p. 119). 

### One Minute Magic

“Time to let you go,” Cayla responded. Steve looked to her, then to the One Minute Manager, for an explanation. “Steve,” he said, “the beauty of developing a self leader is that it ultimately frees managers to focus their attention where it’s most needed. Cayla’s job was to teach you how to be a self leader. She accomplished her goal. It’s time she turned her attention to others who need her.” (p. 125).

“You may not be at the self-reliant achiever level on many of the goals and tasks required in your new job opportunity,” the One Minute Manager said firmly, “but you’ve mastered the three tricks of self leadership. (p. 126).

**Self leaders challenge assumed constraints, activate their points of power, and are proactive about getting what they need to succeed.**
