Notes from, “Aujla, Dr Rupy. The Doctor’s Kitchen: Supercharge your health with 100 delicious everyday recipes. HarperCollins Publishers. Kindle Edition.”

### **Introduction: Food as Medicine**

The foundation for your health journey starts on your plate and it’s more powerful than any pill I can prescribe. (p. 10).

**Why I eat ‘plant-focused’**

Phytochemicals, the chemicals found in plants, are another explanation for the incredible health benefits of fruits and vegetables. These are what give plants their pigment, smell and, importantly, flavour. (p. 30).

I enjoy animal protein of all varieties – fish, poultry, chicken, game and beef – about once or twice a week… Key micronutrients such as zinc and vitamin B12 are nutritional qualities very hard to obtain in purely plant-based diets. (p. 31).

On the subject of meat, I do have concerns about the harmful effects of cheaper mass-produced livestock on our health and the environment. On balance, a stressed, improperly reared animal is not likely to be good for us despite the benefits of convenient protein and nutrients. The type of feed, use of medications and the space an animal has been allowed to roam in all have an impact on their health and can negatively impact ours. (pp. 31-32).

**Health is in the gut of the beholder**

The trillions of microbes (including fungi, bacteria and viruses) largely concentrated in our colon are thought to protect us from infections, break down molecules of food, create neurotransmitters and even alter our immune system. (p. 37).

Fermented foods have a long, well-established history throughout different societies’ eating habits, but a lot has changed in Western diets. We pasteurise, radiate and add a ton of additives to processed foods to make them sterile for convenience and shelf life. All of which have been shown to negatively impact the microbiome. (p. 38).

For now, I encourage experimenting with different ingredients like traditionally prepared kimchi, sauerkrauts and probiotic yoghurts that are full of different strains of bacteria that may have benefits. (p. 40).

Antibiotic medications indiscriminately remove large proportions of bacteria including the beneficial types that are good for us, so I always encourage a reserved attitude to using and requesting them. (p. 41).

**Food is information**

In a very general sense, ensuring we have a variety of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) is the best way to ensure proper functioning of our cells and expression of our genes. (p. 47).

Cruciferous vegetables (also known as brassicas), in particular, are known for their sulforaphane content. Sulforaphane is a plant chemical currently being researched for its ability to stabilise cells and protect against cancer. (p. 48).

Cauliflower, broccoli, broccoli sprouts and rocket leaves all contain sulforaphane, plus a whole lot more that hasn’t yet been fully investigated… They are also full of micronutrients like magnesium and folate which are vital for repairing and producing DNA. (p. 48).

Simple herbs like parsley, for example, contain plant chemicals called flavones. These are known to promote the activity of genes that are responsible for suppressing inflammation, a key feature in conditions like cancer and diabetes. And it’s not just parsley … rosemary, turmeric, ginger, oregano, onion and garlic are also abundant with health-promoting chemicals including epigalletins, quercetin, luteolin and others with equally long and confusing names. (p. 49).

### **Diet Choice Fatigue**

I’ll let you into a secret you probably already know by now: there is no such thing as a ‘perfect diet’. (p. 54).

**Paleo, Low-carb high-fat, Atkins, South Beach, Ketogenic**

Carbs. That’s good, isn’t it?’ Well, not necessarily. The principles of Paleo, South Beach and Atkins are quite similar. They revolve around reducing your intake of carbohydrate and replacing it with varying proportions of protein and fats, with ‘low-carb high-fat’ (aka LCHF) and Ketogenic diets being the most excessive in terms of fat consumption. They’ve been reported in clinical studies to improve markers of diabetes and famously autoimmune disease in a number of protocols. (pp. 55-56).

However, there is some evidence pointing toward high protein intake being similarly harmful as high carbohydrate intake, which is the trap a lot of people fall into when following these diets. And let’s not forget the side effects that include: constipation, halitosis, nausea, renal stones, osteoporosis and a potentially increased risk of bowel cancer (among many others). (p. 56).

**SIRT diet**

‘SIRT’ genes are what this diet is named after and increasing the activity of these genes (and the proteins they code for) is thought to reduce inflammation, control blood sugar and has been linked to reducing cancer risk. (p. 58).

Yes, parsley, dark chocolate and green tea all increase SIRT gene expression but they also contain catechins, luteolin and a host of micronutrients that are essential for processes in our body’s cells. As do lupini beans, cavolo nero, broccoli, coriander, chilli and a whole bunch of foods that don’t fit a particular list. I think it completely misses the point to focus on an exclusive group of ingredients, and it doesn’t encourage a healthy relationship with food. Every ingredient deserves a platform. (p. 58).

**5:2 diet**

I am convinced that some people have found benefits from this practice,120 but if I were to tell the majority of patients I see in clinic to reduce their calories to 500 for two whole days, I know exactly where they’d be telling me to go! (p. 59).

Research also shows that the simple effort of ensuring you eat at regular times and within a 10–11-hour window can reduce your risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It stabilises insulin release and leads to less fat around the organs (which is dangerous). It makes logical sense to me and a lot of my patients are easily able to slot this convenient ‘fasting’ practice into their eating habits that doesn’t require obsessive calorie counting or restriction. (pp. 60-61).

**Alkaline diet**

When non-medically trained, self-styled, health ‘gurus’ are given a platform to influence people into believing they can change their blood pH with a diet high in alkaline foods, it is incredibly frustrating… When you’ve spent time in intensive care, learnt about the complexities of acid-base balance in ill patients and tried to get your head around how complicated pH control is,126,127 you can understand why the use of alkaline theories to promote products annoy doctors all round. (p. 61).

**Low Fat/Slimming World/NHS Choices**

The medical profession’s obsession with reducing the fat content of our food and encouraging processed, low-fat options over the past few decades has probably been the most effective, yet destructive, health campaign of all time. (p. 62).

The recommendations for extreme restriction of saturated fat, cholesterol and total fat are now becoming obsolete and further analysis is proving fat not to be as detrimental to health as we once thought. (p. 62).

My honest opinion is that we shouldn’t fear fat… Your environment, gut microbes and ancestry play a major role in predicting the success of any given diet and lowering your risk of disease, but I believe a good proportion of good-quality fats are essential to health. (p. 63).

**Veganism**

I’m a huge supporter of a diet largely made up of fruits and vegetables, but pure veganism doesn’t come without its caveats. B vitamins are noticeably lacking in vegans, as well as zinc, essential fatty acids and vitamin D. Careful supplementation with extra nutrients is something I would advise all 100-per-cent plant-based eaters to discuss with their health practitioner. (p. 64).

### **Worth the extra spend?**

The following ‘health’ ingredients, add flavour and texture and I believe are worth the extra pounds on your weekly shopping bill. (p. 78).

**Hemp seeds**

These are one of the most concentrated sources of plant-based protein available. The seeds have a whopping amount of fibre and a great fatty acid profile to make them a potentially heart-health-promoting product. (pp. 78-79).

for largely plant-based eaters like myself.178 The nutty and slight oily texture of the seeds makes them a great addition to smoothies or granola, and toasted with spices they make an awesome salad topper. The seeds are easier on your digestion than most processed protein powders and far more nutritionally dense. (p. 79).

**Cacao powder**

Raw cocoa beans are roasted and ground to create this bitter, antioxidant- and flavanol-rich product that I use in everything from Mexican Mole (see here) to vegan ice cream… It’s a complete protein (i.e. it contains all nine essential amino acids) and its phytochemical profile is off the charts! (p. 79).

You can get the same nutritional benefits from using high-quality dark chocolate powder, which I don’t think I could live without (75 percent cocoa solids or higher is ideal). (p. 80).

**Quinoa**

It’s good value and widely available, it’s easy to cook and it has a better nutritional profile than rice, bread or pasta (higher in protein, with more vitamins and minerals186), plus we even produce some right here in the UK! It contains all essential amino acids and the dark varieties possess even more antioxidants than the white. (p. 80).

**Extra Virgin Olive Oil**

In the context of a low-sugar, nutrient-dense diet, olive oil has been shown to potentially be protective of heart health and, importantly, makes food so much more enjoyable… The difference in taste between poor- and high-quality EVOO is noticeable to even the least refined of palates. Spend a few extra pounds on organic, cold-pressed193 olive oil – your heart will thank you for it. (p. 81).

**Matcha**

I hesitated to include it because I appreciate it is an expensive product, but the evidence on its dual role in both cancer prevention and helping those undergoing cancer treatment is really interesting. (p. 81).

It contains one of the richest and varied sources of polyphenols of any ingredient and the beneficial effects are seen when it’s consumed in its whole form. Rather than taking a supplement of one of its chemicals, enjoy a cup of green tea the traditional way. (p. 82).

**Flaxseeds/ Linseeds**

Like shelled hemp seed, it’s a great source of Omega-3 fats199 and fibre, and it’s full of protein… For now, it’s an all-round nutritious ingredient that I use in everything from smoothies to my Meatless Meatballs. (p. 83).

**Berries**

Most of us are aware of the antioxidant punch that dark berries offer. The multiple different phytochemicals, such as anthocyanins, that give rise to their beautiful pigments, have heart-protective effects, may shield against dementia and are implicated in why certain populations live longer on average… Fresh berries are often the most expensive fruit on the shelves, but frozen berries are much cheaper and sufficiently hold their nutritional value. (p. 83).

### **Supplements**

Taking a random multi-vitamin every day has consistently been shown in large trials to not positively affect our health… We are more complicated than a collection of a few chemical compounds, so save your pounds for some real nutrients and spend it on good-quality whole food.

Furthermore, studies that used isolated plant chemicals (e.g. resveratrol and curcumin) and had patients arbitrarily supplement with them at high doses did not find them beneficial. (p. 94).

Having said all this, I do believe supplementation with certain micronutrients is worthwhile discussing with your practitioner, as a lot of people tend to be deficient in them, especially in the UK. (p. 95).

- Vitamin D
- Vitamin B12
- Iron
- Omega-3 (EPA/DHA/algae source)

### **The doctor’s principles of eating + living well**

Whether it’s to nurture your microbiome, maximise your genetic potential or even improve your mental wellbeing, everything appears to boil down to some core principles. (p. 99).

- Eat colourful foods.
- Focus on plant protein.
- Don’t forget fibre
- Don’t fear fats.
- Define your hours of eating.
- Remove refined food from your diet.
- Sleep your way to health.
- Electronic daily detox.
- Daily movement.
- Mindfulness.

### **What the doctor ordered**

The aim of this cookbook is to take you on a journey of discovery and tell you why food is so important… By using a multitude of ingredients that are health promoting, I hope to show you that a healthy way of life is not mundane, bland or difficult. (p. 112).

**Peas**

Peas are such a powerful ingredient. A source of fibre, phytonutrients and plant-based protein, there is so much nutrition locked up in these tiny green balls… They control blood sugar and contain a range of phytochemicals that may improve cholesterol ratios and gut functioning. These are a must in my freezer. I always have them to hand, especially when I work odd shifts and need to make quick, tasty meals. Blend them into falafel mixes, soups or dips to add protein and flavour. (p. 143).

**Broccoli Sprouts**

They are a concentrated source of the phytochemical sulforaphane, one of the most powerful food ingredients in nature that we know of, which has been shown to drastically lower inflammation as well as heighten the liver’s ability to remove environmental pollutants. (p. 175).

So, a dressing made with extra-virgin olive oil, sun-dried tomatoes, English mustard powder, salt and pepper, tossed with broccoli sprouts, may be one of the best combinations for getting the most out of this important ingredient. (p. 175).

**Celeriac**

Celeriac contains good amounts of vitamin K and B vitamins, which are both essential for the proper functioning of our liver. It is also a source of apigenin, a member of a class of phytochemicals called flavones, which is being studied for its ability to stop cells transforming into cancer… I like mashing this delicious ingredient to make a nutrient-dense purée, adding a quality source of fat to help absorption of the vitamins. (p. 197).

**Sprouted Beans and Seeds**

These cheap and protein-rich ingredients are popping up in supermarket salad-leaf sections everywhere, but they are much more than just salad toppers. Sprouting beans and seeds is a method of making them digestible for consumption by removing a large proportion of chemicals called anti-nutrients that can bind to minerals (reducing their absorption) and irritate the lining of the gut… These anti-nutrients – that include phytates, tannins and lectins – actually confer health benefits: they’re known to be protective against cancer and improve cardiovascular health. (p. 235).

**Sweet Potato**

I like to roast them, cube and sauté them, or steam and mash them with greens, a knob of butter and seasoning. The fibre in sweet potato is fantastic for improving the functioning of our gut microbes and they’re less likely than white potatoes to cause spikes in your blood-sugar level after consumption. (p. 280).

**Beetroot**

This cheap, vibrant vegetable is known to improve protection against cardiovascular disease, as well as enhance athletic performance because of its ability to increase levels of nitric oxide in the blood. (p. 292).

Its robust, earthy flavour stands up well to roasting and I like to mix it up by finely slicing it raw into sautéed vegetables with cumin. I try to eat it a few times a week, as it is one of the most phytochemical-rich vegetables and one of the richest sources of anthocyanins that we have access to in this country… Eat it whole, as its fibre content is fantastic and lost by juicing. (p. 292).

**Red Cabbage**

Locked in its crisp leaves are powerful inflammation-fighting compounds that, in multiple scientific studies, have been shown to defend against cellular damage… Finely shredded into curries, cut into chunks and roasted or pickled – there are lots of great ways you can enjoy this ingredient. (p. 337).

**Carrots**

The humble carrot is a rich source of fibre, not to mention antioxidants like beta-carotene… Carotenoids are a group of plant chemicals that give carrots their orange pigment and are thought to have a role in gene expression and promoting healthy cell function which protects us against disease… I grate them raw into salad, chop them to add to stir-fries or use them as crudité with homemade hummus for quick snacks at work. (p. 359).
